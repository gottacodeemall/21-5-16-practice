concepts used:
html basics
css basics
skeleton
flexbox

### Problems:
* imgs are not responsive to web design
  - Problem here is that images are of different dimensions. So they appear with different sizes if you don't give width and height.
  - If you give width in pixels, that will break the    responsiveness.
    Best option is to use %widths. Another thing to note is that images will not appear in perfect circle (since they are not square) unless you give same height and width.
    The best approach would be to give max-width:100%.

* not able to properly use flexbox relied on skeleton for div aligning.
 - So flexbox!. Skeleton isn't based on flexbox, is it?. The flex-container contentwrapper looks pretty neat to me.

* i hav divided the form into 3 sections in the footer so when sending to php server will all the 3 elements enter or only submit will pass through??
 - All the input data will be send to the php server. All of
  that, will be covered when we start PHP.

### Remarks

- Good Work!. Keep Going.
