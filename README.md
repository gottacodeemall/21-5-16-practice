concepts used:
html basics
css basics
skeleton
flexbox

problems:
1) imgs are not responsive to web design
2) not able to properly use flexbox relied on skeleton for div aligning.
3) i hav divided the form into 3 sections in the footer so when sending to php server will all the 3 elements enter or only submit will pass through??
